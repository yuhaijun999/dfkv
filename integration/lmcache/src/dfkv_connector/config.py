"""URL parsing for the dfkv LMCache connector.

URL grammar is intentionally minimal:

    dfkv://<endpoint>/<group>

where <endpoint> is interpreted by the membership mode (passed in from the
adapter via extra_config, default "mds"):

  - membership="mds"    (default): <endpoint> is a comma-separated MDS host:port
                                   list. dfkv_open() gets an empty member list and
                                   the ring is populated by background MDS
                                   discovery against <endpoint> for <group>.
  - membership="static":           <endpoint> is a literal dfkv member string
                                   "name=ip:port,name2=ip:port2" passed straight to
                                   dfkv_open(); <group> is unused.

Anything else — the libdfkv.so path, MDS poll interval, connector knobs — goes
through the LMCache yaml's ``extra_config`` (see adapter.py). URLs carrying a
query string (``?k=v``) are rejected with a message pointing at extra_config.
