"""Per-process LRU set short-circuiting Exists() lookups.

Rationale: LMCache's batched_async_contains is on the prefetch hot path. The
overwhelming common case is "I just put this key, now I'm asking does it
exist?" — answering yes from memory avoids a remote round-trip.

Tolerates false positives (server evicts a key we know about; the subsequent
Get returns NotFound and LMCache handles it). Does NOT tolerate false
negatives — on miss we must always check remotely.
